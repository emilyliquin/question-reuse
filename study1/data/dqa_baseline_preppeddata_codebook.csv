id,participant id number
trial,"question asking task trial number (1-4, in order)"
AgeGroup,age group (Kids or Adults)
AgeGroup_Split,"Age group, split into bins within children (5- to 6-year-olds, 7- to 8-year-olds, 9- to 10-year-olds, adults)"
age_yr,age in years (for children only)
age_mo,age in months (for children only)
age_mo_center,"age in months, mean-centered (for children only)"
n_attempts_color,"in initial task intro, how many attempts total to identify monsters of particular color (e.g., ""Can you click on the purple monster?""). Three total trials, so 3 attempts is perfect performance. Numbers greater than 3 indicate errors. Participants could make an error twice on each trial before being forced to select the correct response, so max score is 9 (three attempts on each trial, where the last attempt is a forced correct response)."
n_attempts_head,"in initial task intro, how many attempts total to identify monsters of particular head shape (e.g., ""Can you click on the monster with a circle head?""). Two total trials, so 2 attempts is perfect performance. Numbers greater than 2 indicate errors. Participants could make an error twice on each trial before being forced to select the correct response, so max score is 6 (three attempts on each trial, where the last attempt is a forced correct response)."
n_attempts_legs,"in initial task intro, how many attempts total to identify monsters with particular number of legs (e.g., ""Can you click on the monster with two legs?""). Three total trials, so 3 attempts is perfect performance. Numbers greater than 3 indicate errors. Participants could make an error twice on each trial before being forced to select the correct response, so max score is 9 (three attempts on each trial, where the last attempt is a forced correct response)."
trial_index,unique trial type -- ranges from 1-14. Each trial type defines a unique hint
hint_a,"hint for the first monster (left) -- first is color (r=red, b=blue, p=purple), second is head shape (sq=square, cir=circle, 0 = hidden), third is number of legs (1, 2, 3, or 0=hidden)"
hint_b,"hint for the second monster (middle) -- first is color (r=red, b=blue, p=purple), second is head shape (sq=square, cir=circle, 0 = hidden), third is number of legs (1, 2, 3, or 0=hidden)"
hint_c,"hint for the third monster (right) -- first is color (r=red, b=blue, p=purple), second is head shape (sq=square, cir=circle, 0 = hidden), third is number of legs (1, 2, 3, or 0=hidden)"
r_shape,"shape of the red monster's head (-1 = hidden, 1 = square, 2 = circle)"
r_legs,"number of legs of the red monster (-1 = hidden, 1, 2, 3)"
b_shape,"shape of the blue monster's head (-1 = hidden, 1 = square, 2 = circle)"
b_legs,"number of legs of the blue monster (-1 = hidden, 1, 2, 3)"
p_shape,"shape of the purple monster's head (-1 = hidden, 1 = square, 2 = circle)"
p_legs,"number of legs of the purple monster (-1 = hidden, 1, 2, 3)"
question,"asked question. Note: this includes some amount of pre-cleaning, e.g., removing anything that was said before/after the child's asked question. However, we did not correct grammatical errors."
question_standard,standardized text version of question (used for text-based similarity measure)
question_program,question program translation
question_abstracted_idealized,"question program translation, abstracting away free parameters"
EIG,informativeness of asked question (expected information gain)
entropy,overall uncertainty for the present trial (max possible information gain)
notes,"was question skipped, ambiguous, invalid, not in grammar, etc."
n_operations,how many functions are in the question total (proxy for complexity)
n_unique_operations,how many unique functions are in the question (proxy for complexity)
same_as_last,does this question repeat a question template used by the same participant on any previous trial?
sim_to_last_standard,what is the maximum degree of text similarity between the standardized question asked on this trial and all previous-trial standardized questions (excluding instances of reuse)
prev_trial_indices_reuse,"which previous trial indices were used for computing same_as_last (i.e., which previous trials had a valid question)"
prev_trial_indices_remixing,"which previous trial indices were used for computing sim_to_last_standard (i.e., which previous trials had a valid question AND were not instances of reuse)"
