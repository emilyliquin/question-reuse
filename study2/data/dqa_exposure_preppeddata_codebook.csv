quality_cond,"previous quality condition (good = previously-informative, bad = previously-uninformative)"
exposure_cond,"exposure condition (exposure or baseline, i.e., no-exposure)"
n_attempts_color,"in initial task intro, how many attempts total to identify monsters of particular color (e.g., ""Can you click on the purple monster?""). Three total trials, so 3 attempts is perfect performance. Numbers greater than 3 indicate errors. Participants could make an error twice on each trial before being forced to select the correct response, so max score is 9 (three attempts on each trial, where the last attempt is a forced correct response)."
n_attempts_head,"in initial task intro, how many attempts total to identify monsters of particular head shape (e.g., ""Can you click on the monster with a circle head?""). Two total trials, so 2 attempts is perfect performance. Numbers greater than 2 indicate errors. Participants could make an error twice on each trial before being forced to select the correct response, so max score is 6 (three attempts on each trial, where the last attempt is a forced correct response)."
n_attempts_legs,"in initial task intro, how many attempts total to identify monsters with particular number of legs (e.g., ""Can you click on the monster with two legs?""). Three total trials, so 3 attempts is perfect performance. Numbers greater than 3 indicate errors. Participants could make an error twice on each trial before being forced to select the correct response, so max score is 9 (three attempts on each trial, where the last attempt is a forced correct response)."
exp_answer_response,"In practice trial, what response did the participant select to answer the confederate's question?"
exp_answer_correct,"In practice trial, what was the correct response (that the participant should have selected)?"
trial_index,"combination of trial type (best, nonbest, overcomplex, zero) and question condition—each unique trial index is associated with a unique hint"
trial_type,"trial type: best=best, nonbest=medium, overcomplex=too-complex, zero=worst"
hint_a,"hint for the first monster (left) -- first is color (r=red, b=blue, p=purple), second is head shape (sq=square, cir=circle, 0 = hidden), third is number of legs (1, 2, 3, or 0=hidden)"
hint_b,"hint for the second monster (middle) -- first is color (r=red, b=blue, p=purple), second is head shape (sq=square, cir=circle, 0 = hidden), third is number of legs (1, 2, 3, or 0=hidden)"
hint_c,"hint for the third monster (right) -- first is color (r=red, b=blue, p=purple), second is head shape (sq=square, cir=circle, 0 = hidden), third is number of legs (1, 2, 3, or 0=hidden)"
r_shape,"shape of the red monster's head (-1 = hidden, 1 = square, 2 = circle)"
r_legs,"number of legs of the red monster (-1 = hidden, 1, 2, 3)"
b_shape,"shape of the blue monster's head (-1 = hidden, 1 = square, 2 = circle)"
b_legs,"number of legs of the blue monster (-1 = hidden, 1, 2, 3)"
p_shape,"shape of the purple monster's head (-1 = hidden, 1 = square, 2 = circle)"
p_legs,"number of legs of the purple monster (-1 = hidden, 1, 2, 3)"
